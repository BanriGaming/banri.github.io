    <h2>How to start expedition</h2>
    <p>
        To start the expedition, you have two options:<br>
        You can start a new game in Expedition mode<br>
        Or you can summon the Space Anomaly from any existing save and start the expedition from expedition terminal.<br>
        The second option is better, as you can bring resources and technologies with you, or even bring a copy of your starship or multitool, which greatly speeds up expedition progress!
    </p>
    <h2>Preparation (Optional)</h2>
    <p>First of all, if you're a veteran player, you can make the run much easier by bringing some resources with you!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>This time you can bring 64 Activated Copper, 99 Atlantideum, 12 wiring looms, and 100 salt, along with Gold, Chromatic metal, magnetized ferrite and Sodium Nitrate.</li>
        <li>Everything you bring will be available at the same terminal within the expedition! <b>To retrieve items, you must warp once - this will unlock the space anomaly within the expedition!</b> In other words, the initial mining is <b>inevitable!</b></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notable things during expedition</h2>
    <p>Keep in mind these two things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Don't forget to <b>claim</b> rewards for milestones, as some of them contain plans for the next milestones.</li>
        <li>Also, use the <b>refiner</b> if you need to process anything.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Guide</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Once you start the expedition, document plants and animals you find around and mine basic resources such as carbon, oxygen, and so on.</li>
