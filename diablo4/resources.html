        <a href="https://helltides.com/">Helltides Tracker & Map</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Helltides Tool is an amazing website for tracking helltides, world boss spawns and legion events. It has an option to notify you when it even starts and shows you when the next one is.
        During Helltides, it will display an interactive map that shows all locations of mystery chests, season chests, and regular chests and when the chests rotate/reset.
    </p>

    <h3>
        <a href="https://diablo4.life/">Diablo 4 Life</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Diablo4.Life is probably one of most useful resources outside of maxroll to date. The things it can do is quite amazing. It can do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Gambling Aspects </b>- You use obols at the Purveyor of Curiosities to get gear that can drop legendary items. This tool tells you what gear piece to buy for the best possible drop chance for selected aspects you are hunting for.</li>
        <li><b>Unique Target Farming </b>- Looking for a specific Unique for your build? Find the item you need in the list and select it. It will tell you which dungeons, nightmare dungeons or boss that can drop it.</li>
        <li><b>Glyph XP Calculator </b>- This tool is pretty straightforward, you put in your current glyph level, NM Tier you are farming and it will show you how many dungeons needed to reach a target level for the glyph.</li>
        <li><b>Nightmare Dungeons </b>- Best NM Dungeons to farm? Input your level, what World Tier you are on and it will tell you what tier NM Dungeon to target for your selected activity (leveling or glyph leveling), which NM dungeon sigils to keep and what sigil affixes to avoid.</li>
        <li><b>Trackers </b>- The website also has helltide interactive map and trackers for helltides, legion events and world bosses.</li>
        <li><b>Interactive Map & More </b>- Outside of having all that, interactive map, guides, tier lists, build pages. Best tool for D4 currently available.</li>
    </ol>

    </h3>
    <p>Raxx is a player who made an excel sheet that has many useful features such as an optimal leveling path in the overworld (if avoiding dungeons) and a dungeon only way to leveling when starting a season from level 1. 
        He has data for his opinions on a NM Dungeon Tier List that i find very accurate. 
    </p>
    <h3>
        <a href="https://diablo.trade/listings/items">Diablo.trade</a>
    </h3>
    <p>A website mainly created for buying and selling gear from/to other players. I've used it quite often an made hundreds of millions from selling to players. Extremely useful website.</p>
    <h3>
        <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4">Maxroll</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Maxroll is one of the many build guide websites for diablo 4 and the top one in my opinion. Most all builds come from this site. Its got data for literally every activity in the game. Featuring; Tier Lists for Leveling Builds, Endgame Builds, Speedfarming Builds, Data for all Side Quests and Dungeons, Boss Data, and many other useful things.</p>
    <h3>
        <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/">Icy Veins D4 Section</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Another build guide website along with useful guides for the game including ones for the season specifically.</p>
    <h3>
        <a href="https://d4builds.gg/">D4Builds</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Yet another build guide website and pretty much only really made for that. Maxroll is still better IMO. I've seen YouTubers using this site to host their builds alot.</p>
    <h3>
        <a href="https://mobalytics.gg/diablo-4?int_source=homepage&int_medium=header">Mobalytics D4 Section</a>
    </h3>
    <p>And yet another site for builds! This site is probably the most useful website for builds alongside maxroll. YouTubers i've seen mostly display their builds on this website as its organization and readability is amazing.</p>
